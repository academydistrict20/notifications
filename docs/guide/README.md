# Introduction

Use as a dependency to build into your project, or use a CDN and web components to embed directly into an application.

## Using in your project

- [Using the client](../client/README.md) - behavior and actions

- [Using plugins](../plugins/README.md) - add new data sources and extend functionality

- [Using UI Components](../ui/README.md) - find out what data the notification component expects for proper functionality.

- [Embedding](../embed/README.md) - embed notifications using Vue.js or HTML web components.
